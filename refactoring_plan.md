# Refactoring Plan

## Objectives

1. **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Ensure that each module or component has a single responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Easy Testability**: Structure the code to facilitate unit testing, with clear boundaries and mockable dependencies.
3. **Agnosticity Between LLMs**: Design the architecture to support multiple language models (e.g., Ollama, OpenAI, Claude) with minimal changes.
4. **Small Files**: Break down the code into small, self-contained files to improve readability and ease of use with AI assistants.
5. **Leverage Frameworks**: Utilize frameworks and libraries to minimize boilerplate code and focus on core application logic.
6. **Adhere to Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide**: Follow best practices and coding standards as outlined by Airbnb.

## Refactoring Steps

### 1. Component Structure

- **Modularize Components**: Break down large components into smaller, reusable components. For example, separate UI elements and logic in `AppContent` into distinct components.
- **Use Custom Hooks**: Extract reusable logic into custom hooks, such as `useChat` and any other stateful logic.

### 2. Context and State Management

- **Centralize Context Logic**: Move context-related logic to a dedicated context provider module. Ensure that only necessary components are wrapped with context providers.
- **Decouple State Management**: Use a state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to manage global state, making it easier to test and swap out implementations.

### 3. Language Model Agnosticity

- **Abstract LLM Interactions**: Create an abstraction layer for interacting with language models. This layer should define a common interface for different LLMs, allowing easy integration and switching.
- **Configuration-Driven Model Selection**: Use configuration files or environment variables to select the desired LLM at runtime.

### 4. File Organization

- **Organize by Feature**: Group related files by feature or domain, rather than by type. This helps in understanding the codebase structure and reduces cognitive load.
- **Limit File Size**: Aim for files to be under 200 lines of code. Split larger files into smaller modules or components.

### 5. Framework Utilization

- **Leverage React and Libraries**: Use React's built-in features like `Suspense` and `lazy` for code splitting. Utilize libraries like `react-query` for data fetching and caching.
- **Optimize Build Tools**: Use tools like Webpack or Vite for efficient bundling and tree-shaking to reduce the final bundle size.

### 6. Code Style and Best Practices

- **Follow Airbnb Style Guide**: Use ESLint with Airbnb's configuration to enforce consistent coding standards.
- **Refactor for Readability**: Use descriptive variable names, avoid deeply nested code, and prefer functional components over class components.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all components and functions using a testing library like Jest. Focus on testing logic and edge cases.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure that components work together as expected. Use tools like React Testing Library for testing component interactions.
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocking libraries to simulate API calls and external services during testing.

## Conclusion

This refactoring plan aims to create a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase that is easy to test and extend. By following these steps, the project will be well-structured and ready to support multiple language models and future enhancements.
